/**
 * Classes used to interact with real robots.
 *
 * This package contains all code related to sending instructions
 * to real robots. Although different manufacturers expose different
 * APIs to their robots, StarL makes an effort to wrap these APIs in
 * a consistent manner, so that all aerial or ground robots may be
 * controlled with the same interface.
 *
 * New models may be able to reuse an existing interface, or a new
 * one may be required.
